# WhatsApp Contacts and Chats Bypasser

## 📌 About
"WhatsApp Bypasser" is a simple and lightweight Android app that allows users to start a WhatsApp chat to any number **without saving it to contacts**. This makes it easy to quickly message businesses, temporary contacts, or people you don't want to add to your phonebook.

This was mostly done in protest to Whatsapp's invasive privacy mandate on needing contacts access to start a message. This is also useful for connected devices, since they cannot add new contacts or message people that aren't in the main device's contact book.

I built this app, even though many alternatives exist, simply to test out more of the new Android development features. This was quite a fun project and I do plan on maintaining this app and continue development, like adding a button to launch a Signal chat.
