# WhatsApp Contacts and Chats Bypasser

## 📌 About
WhatsApp Bypass is a simple and lightweight Android app that allows users to start a WhatsApp chat with any number **without saving it to contacts**. This makes it easy to quickly message businesses, temporary contacts, or people you don't want to add to your phonebook.

This was mostly done in protest to Whatsapp's invasive privacy mandate on needing contacts access to start a message.

I built this app, even though many alternatives exist, simply to test out more of the new android development features. This was quite a fun project and do plan on maintaining this app and continue the developments, like launching it with Signal.

## 🔥 Features
- **Bypass Contact Saving** – Start WhatsApp chats without adding a number.
- **Minimalist UI** – Simple, clean, and dark mode optimized.
- **No Ads** – 100% free and open-source.
- **Secure & Lightweight** – Small APK size with privacy in mind.
